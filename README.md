# Global Warming Charts 
For the final project for [Start2Impact's](https://www.start2impact.it/) Frontend development course I chose to create a website that  presents key indicators of our changing climate: temperature, greenhouse gases, and Arctic sea ice extent. It's composed of charts made with Recharts that show these statistics. 


## Built with 
- HTML, CSS
- JavaScript
- React 
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US)
- [Global Warming API](https://global-warming.org/)

## Acknowledgements
