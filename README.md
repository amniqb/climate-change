For the final project for [Start2Impact's](https://www.start2impact.it/) Frontend development course I chose to create a website that  presents key indicators of our changing climate: temperature, greenhouse gases, and Arctic sea ice extent. It's composed of charts made with Recharts that show these statistics.
